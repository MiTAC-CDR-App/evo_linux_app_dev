/*! @brief Client interface for video recording and image capture.

    To start an video recording
    clients first should create a session.
    A session can contain multiple video tracks.
    All tracks in a session changes state change
    (say start, stop, pause etc) together.

    Multiple sessions can be created and run at the same time.
    Recorder provides elementary stream callback to clients and clients
    manage the muxer. A/V muxer is not part of the
    Recorder class and hence clients
    need to use an external muxer to save the elementary streams

    For image capture, Recorder API provides single, burst and
    timed image capture
    Image capture APIs are  not associated with session and can
    be triggered independent of session.

    Some of the APIs in the class are sync and others async.
    The API documentation explicitly says whether the API is async.

    Callbacks used for async communication from recorder class are expected
    to be lambda functions. The client is expected to capture the context
    while setting the callback.
